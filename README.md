# Input-Buffer-Experiment
This demonstrates a basic functionality of the input buffer in C++.

I mostly used this project as a way of learning through experimentation, but thought it might help some others understand the input buffer.

To compile, you'll need GCC or G++, and a basic idea of how to use them. It's pretty straightforward, a Google search on how to compile and build a file using G++ should tell you everything you need to know :)

There isn't much in the way of error handling or input sanitization since I'm still learning, but I'll get there someday.
