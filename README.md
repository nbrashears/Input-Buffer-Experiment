# Input-Buffer-Experiment
This demonstrates a basic functionality of the input buffer in C++.

I mostly used this project as a way of learning through experimentation, but thought it might help some others understand the input buffer.

In case of any errors you may encounter, I'm using C++17. Everything was compiled and built using GCC. I hope you find it useful!
